🔍 1. Idea Fit & Alignment
Your idea of a sneaker display case directly aligns with the problem of limited space for sneaker collectors, who often struggle to store and showcase their prized collections. However, “lack of space” can vary widely—from cramped closets to wanting a stylish way to show off shoes—so it would help to clarify whether your solution is primarily about saving space, protecting shoes, or enhancing display aesthetics. Focusing on one or a combination of these angles will tighten your product-market fit and guide design choices.

📊 2. Competitor Snapshot + UVP Insight
1. **Sneaker Shield** – Offers stackable, transparent sneaker boxes focused on protection and easy stacking for space saving.

🧠 3. Customer Targeting & Messaging
Sneaker collectors are a great target, but segmenting further could help: focus on “enthusiast collectors with 20+ pairs who want to both protect and display their shoes.” You can find these customers in sneakerhead forums (like r/Sneakers on Reddit), Instagram sneaker communities, and specialized Facebook groups. Also, consider sneaker conventions and local sneaker meetups.

Try messaging like: **“Protect your collection and show it off—smart, space-saving sneaker display cases designed for true collectors.”** From early conversations, learn whether space-saving or display appeal is more urgent, and what features (e.g., UV protection, stackability, app integration) excite them most.
