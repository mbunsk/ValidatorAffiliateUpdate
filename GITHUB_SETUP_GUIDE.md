# How to Push ValidatorAI to GitHub

## Step 1: Download Your Code
1. Download the `ValidatorAI-Source-Code.zip` file from this Replit
2. Extract it to a folder on your computer

## Step 2: Set Up Local Git Repository
Open terminal/command prompt in the extracted folder and run:

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: ValidatorAI startup validation platform"
```

## Step 3: Connect to GitHub
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (don't initialize with README)
2. Copy the repository URL (should be like: https://github.com/yourusername/validatorai.git)

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables
Your developer will need to set these environment variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

## Step 5: Install and Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting
- If you get authentication errors, you may need to set up a Personal Access Token instead of password
- If the repository already exists, you can force push with: `git push -u origin main --force`
